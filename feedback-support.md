## Feedback and support

Feedback is very much welcome and greatly appreciated!

You can get in touch by opening [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/3Tissue/MRtrix3Tissue/issues/new/choose), even if you're not really having an "issue", but just want to provide some feedback. You'll need a GitHub account: if you don't already have one, no worries, it's free and easy to create in a minute.

If you'd like to contribute, you can do so at the moment by sharing feedback about your experience with the [SS3T-CSD algorithm]({% link doc/ss3t-csd.md %}) (even if it all seems to work just fine!). Make sure to include basic information on the data you're trying to process (e.g. b-value, number of gradient directions and number of b=0 images) and as many screenshots of your (attempted) results as you're happy to share.

If you're looking for support, you can also open an issue (there's an option specifically to "ask a question"). However, if your question is more general, e.g. related to general diffusion MRI processing, or installation of the software or the prerequisite dependencies in specific environments, you might also want to consider posting on the [MRtrix3 community forum](https://community.mrtrix.org): there's an active community of MRtrix3 users who might be able to quickly help you out and the community will benefit in the future from any questions and answers resulting from your post. Since MRtrix3Tissue is *a fork of the MRtrix3 project*, a lot of information and discussions apply across the board. Everyone wins if we share and discuss openly.
